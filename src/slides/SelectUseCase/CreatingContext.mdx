# What will our context have?

<div style={{ width: "100%", height: 600, textAlign: "center" }}>
  <Svg>
    <SelectSchema />
  </Svg>
</div>

- **`open`**: shows of hides the options panel.
- **`labelPosition`**: saves the current label position because the
  `SelectLabel` subcomponent does not know how to be positioned in the
  `SelectContent` layout.
- **`selectedValue`**: saves the current selected value, not the entire option
  with the label.
- **`options`**: saves all the options registered via `SelectOption`
  subcomponent.
- **`isReady`**: isReady is set to true after mounting all subcomponents. Needed
  to do a little trick because the options wouldn't be mounted until the popover
  is opened, but we wouldn't have options at the initial time because they
  haven't been mounted
